                Food packing can be one of the most difficult parts of trip planning. Backcountry meal planner was created to simplify the process and provide information about meals and ingredients. It uses a meal based system to calculate food quantities, so you donâ€™t end up carrying extra weight or run out of food. It is designed for fast and light solo trips as well as large group expeditions. Nutrition data is available for each meal, so food can be planned based on calories. Dietary info such as vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free is also available for each meal, to simplify meal planning for group expeditions.
